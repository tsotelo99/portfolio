I am Teresa Rodriguez Sotelo, a history detective with a love for stories that time almost forgot. I was born and raised in El Tarengo, Jalisco, México. I moved to Lynwood, California, in 2014, and during my high school years, my passion for Mexican history grew exponentially. I started my higher education at East Los Angeles College, then transferred to the University of California, Santa Cruz to complete my BA. My MA is from California State University, Los Angeles, and I am currently a second-year PhD student in history at the University of New Mexico. As a researcher, I am passionate about uncovering the stories of marginalized communities. I specialize in Latin American history, focusing on women in social movements during the 1960s. Through my work, I aim to make the past accessible and engaging for everyone. When I’m not researching, you’ll find me hiking in the mountains, cross-stitching, cooking pozole, or visiting my family. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch!
