My work begins with wind and ends with rhythm. I am fascinated by the unnoticed movements that govern our lives—the subtle swaying of grass, the imperceptible shift of shadows across a wall, the tidal pulse of breath that carries us from dawn to sleep. My sculptures are collaborations with these invisible forces. By giving steel, wood, and glass a chance to dance with air currents, I am inviting the environment to finish the artwork for me. What I make is not still, and therefore, never fully finished.

I draw inspiration from the mechanics of insect wings, the pendulum swings of old clocks, and the ritual motions of daily human life—stirring tea, hanging laundry, pacing while thinking. I use simple materials, but they are carefully tuned so that the smallest nudge—a breeze, a passerby’s presence, a vibration in the floor—sets them in motion. I want my pieces to remind viewers that movement is a kind of conversation: we touch the world, and the world answers back.

Ultimately, my sculptures are experiments in patience and perception. They reward the slow observer—the one who lingers long enough to notice a sudden spin, a gradual oscillation, a flash of sunlight refracting through a moving panel. Each piece is a kind of clock that doesn’t tell time but instead reveals the hidden choreography of a particular place. If you stand quietly enough, you can feel that choreography in your body, and perhaps find yourself moving in response.
