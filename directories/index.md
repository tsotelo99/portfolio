# Directories
Even for a small class or small project, you need to have some kind of directory or table of contents for your content. Xanthan comes with a few ways to do this, and of course more can be added.


## Table of Contents
One familiar approach is to create a table of contents for your site pages, like you'd find in a book. Let's say you have a collection of pages, like student essays, that you want to create a table of contents for. We can do this automatically, as long as each page has a little metadata at the top of the file in the YML header.

```

title: My Essay Title
author: Fred Gibbs
summary: This is a short but provocative summary of my essay
---
```

We can use this data to automatically generate links to the essays. Below, we create a list of from data on pages in Xanthan's `essays` folder. 
- First, we define a variable called `pages` (it could be anything) that gathers all the metadata from the files in the essays folder. 
- Then we send that data to our include file, which has the HTML code to generate the a list themselves. The code below produces the Toc rows just below it. 


```
{%raw%}{% assign pages = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.path contains 'essays/'" %}

{% include toc.html rows = pages %}{%endraw%}
```

{% assign pages = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.path contains 'essays/'" %}

{% include toc.html rows = pages %}

## Stacked cards
A little fancier than a ToC-style list, we can a generate of a stack of horizontal "cards" in the same way. In terms of gathering data to display, this works exactly like above. But it calls a different include file, which presents a stack of wide and short cards in a vertical display. 

```
{%raw%}{% assign essays = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.path contains 'essays/'" %}

{% include card-grid.html cards = essays %}{%endraw%}
```

{% assign essays = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.path contains 'essays/'" %}
{% include card-list.html cards = essays %}



## Grid cards
You can see more cards at a glance if you use a grid layout with slightly smaller cards.

```
{%raw%}{% assign essays = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.path contains 'essays/'" %}

{% include card-grid.html cards = essays %}{%endraw%}
```

{% assign essays = site.pages | where_exp: "page", "page.path contains 'essays/'" %}
{% include card-grid.html cards = essays %}


## Left Navbar
Another way of getting to pages on your site can be through a nav bar that always stays on the left side of the page. Check out the [left navbar demo page](left-navbar).


## Custom displays
We can list your pages just about however you'd like. Let's say your students made poscasts, assigned them one or more tags, and and you wanted a way to list them. We can make something like a [podcast listing](../podcasts). 


## Styling your directory
All the HTML code that makes the cards follows the standard [Bootstrap card model](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/), which makes it easy to adjust the layout following Bootstrap documentation and examples.
