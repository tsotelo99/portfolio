# Left Nav Demo
This page, using the `left-nav` layout, enables the left navigation bar! The left nav provides quick access and list of all pages in specified folder. This is useful for compactly listing a collections of essays, such as with a collaborative course project with individual essay pages.

## How it works
The left nav bar automatically finds all the pages in a specified folder. For Xanthan, we list pages in our `essays` folder. Each essay will have a `toc-header` field in its YML header that specifies what category it should get listed under.

## Essays go here
This right-hand side of the page is where the student essay would go, perhaps something like the essays linked to on the left (but the essays themselves don't use the left-nav layout, just the top nav bar).
