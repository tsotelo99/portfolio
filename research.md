## Research Interests

My research explores the intersection of digital technology, public history, and community engagement, with a focus on how virtual platforms can expand access to cultural heritage. My work centers on the creation of virtual museums and interactive 3D reconstructions that reimagine how audiences engage with the past, particularly in the U.S. Southwest and borderlands. I am especially interested in community-driven archiving practices and the ethical dimensions of digitizing memory, using metadata management and data visualization as tools to tell more inclusive historical narratives.

My scholarship also reflects a strong commitment to pedagogy and public engagement. I investigate how digital literacy and humanistic computing can be used to empower students and local communities to participate actively in preserving and interpreting history. Through my conference presentations, publications, and collaborative workshops, I highlight the potential of emerging technologies, such as GIS mapping, augmented reality, and interactive exhibits, to reframe histories of migration, identity, and place.
