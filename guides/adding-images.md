# Adding Images
One of the greatest of the many advantages of digital essays is the opportunity to use design and visual imagery to engage your readers more than a traditional analog essay would. Adding images do your site pages or essays can be done quickly in just a few steps. As a general overview:
1. Put your image in an appropriate folder in your repository 
2. Create a link to that image on some page (or pages)

## Getting images into your repository
This looks like a lot of steps, but they all take 3 seconds. Assuming you already have an appropriately sized image:
- Log into your repository
- Navigate to the folder where you'd like to upload your image
- If that folder doesn't exist, navigate to the parent folder (wherever you'd like to create a new folder)
- Click the `Add file` button
- Drag and Drop the image into the dotted box
- Click the `Commit Change` button
- Click the pencil icon to edit your image
- Update the path just above the edit window (use backspace and / to edit the path)
- Usually it's best to keep images in your `/assets/images/` folder


## Referencing your image
Now you need to get that image to appear on a page. To ensure images appear consistently across the website, we use a little code snippet from our `_includes` folder. For instructions and options on how to do that, see the [images page](../components/images).
